Difference between Window, Screen and Document in JavaScript


Window:  Window is the main JavaScript root also known as Global Object in a Browser and it can also be treated as the root of the Document Object Model (DOM).
Window is the root of everything.

Screen:  Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions. Screen just has screen dimensions.

Document: Document is the main object of the potentially visible Document Object Model (DOM). Document is top DOM.
